role of urban explorers drawn to dangerously abandoned places. For these people, it is exciting to discover lost arts, lost treasures and abandoned buildings, schools and other abandoned places.\r\n\r\nBut when they discover a spooky place - one that even the authorities advise against visiting - their adventures take a terrifying turn. The explorers are determined to learn the dark secrets of the abandoned place, so they ignore the warnings and follow their curiosity into its depths.\r\n\r\nBut an unforeseen turn of events quickly puts a stop to their exploration. They unexpectedly find themselves trapped in the abandoned building, with unknown forces blocking their way out. The explorers must work together to endure the horrors within and find a way out before it is too late, as fear sets in and they realize they are not alone.\r\n\r\nPlayers must use all their bravery to solve puzzles, navigate the dangerous corridors and outwit the monster that wants to trap them in its evil clutches while time is of the essence.\r\n\r\n[b]Multiple Escape Routes:[/b] Confront a challenge with multiple distinct escape routes.\r\n\r\n[b]Dynamic Co-op Gameplay:[/b] Team up with friends in intense cooperative gameplay. Try to escape alone or together.\r\n\r\n[b]Relentless Pursuit:[/b] Face a relentless AI-driven monster that can hear your every step.\r\n\r\n[b]Immersive Hide-and-Seek:[/b] Utilize your surroundings for survival. Hide in cabinets, under tables, and in the shadows to outsmart the lurking terror. Every decision could mean the difference between life and a gruesome demise.\r\n\r\n[b]Find Items and Escape:[/b] To escape you have to find the right items that are distributed around the location and use them at the right place. Can you make it before it gets you?","strSnippet":"PANICORE is a survival horror game that mixes permadeath, AI monsters and a co-op experience up to 5 players (4 players in demo).
